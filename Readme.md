# Go Programming


## Week 1: Introduction to Go Basics

In the first week of my Go learning journey, I focused on grasping the core fundamentals of the language. I began with understanding the basic syntax and structure of a Go program, which helped me get comfortable with how Go code is written and organized.

I explored how to use `fmt.Printf` for displaying formatted output and `fmt.print`/`fmt.Scan` for reading input from users. These functions were essential in building interactive programs and helped me understand how input/output works in Go.

I also learned how to declare and initialize variables using both the `var` keyword and the short declaration syntax `(:=)`. This gave me insight into Goâ€™s type system and how it handles variable assignments.

Another key area was learning how to perform arithmetic operations in Go, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Additionally, I worked with if-else conditions, to write logic that could make decisions based on user input or variable values. This was useful in building small programs that categorized or responded to different inputs.
